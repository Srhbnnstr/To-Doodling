## About To-Doodling

I wanted to create an app to manage productivity and allow visual thinkers
to jot down quick doodles as well. Being able to keep all of your thoughts in
one orderly place in a aesthetically pleasing manner was the goal of To-Doodling,
and I hope to add many more convenient features in the future.

##  Unsolved Problems & Future Features
* Saving tasks as completed, they currently only get checked off aesthetically.
* Saving drawings to database, users can doodle on the sketchpad, but I haven't
gotten them to save yet.
* Need to add a modal for each task on the calendar that has info about each task
and a count down to how many days a user has left until the task is due.
* Need to add mailer alerts for when a task is near approaching.
* I'd like to add a third party login method (such as facebook), for multiple auth
options and ease of login.
* Need to file uploading method for user new and edit forms.
